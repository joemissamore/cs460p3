Names: Sergio Hernandez, Joe Missamore, John Salman
Date: 12/15/18

What Works:
     Generates compilable code for all 4 tests cases.

What Doesn't:
     Outputs uneccessary semicolons, that could lead to errors in larger files.

How long it would take to fix:
    Another half day of work, but may be an issue with project architecture (on our side).
